### Hi, I'm Jeffery! 👋


🎓 Currently I am studying Computer Science and Business Administration (Double Degree) at the University of Waterloo!

📚 In the past, I’ve developed full-stack applications using Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, C/C++

💻 In the future, my dream is to work with technology to develop transformative products that solve pressing issues.

🍽️ In my free time, I like to compete in hackathons, case competitions and sports. 

🌎 I love exploring new places and meeting new people!
